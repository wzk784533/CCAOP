﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿**CCAOP**>endow your c++ code the ability of AOP, without even altering or recompling it.**Introduction**---With the boom of Internet, Spring has became very popular among the Java developers. AOP, as  a pillar of Spring's key features, has been used massively in Java as a design pattern that C++, by and large, has not.This is a tool to generate boilerplate C++ code﻿, which can hook any C++ class member function( not inline ) you specify.You can write your own code, run before or after the function you hook without even altering or recompiling the program you want to hook. This endows you the ability of AOP in C++ world, roughly though.**Getting Started**---In the sample folder, there are a few c++ code:> foo.h```#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;class Foo {	 public:	 	void showMessage();};```> foo.cpp```#include "foo.h"void Foo::showMessage(){	cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;}```using this command to complie the dynamic library:> gcc foo.cpp -shared -fPIC -o libfoo.so -g> test.cpp```#include "foo.h"int main(){	Foo x;	x.showMessage();	return 0;}```using this command to complie the executable file:>  g++ test.cpp -o ccaoptest -lfoo -L./> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./> ./ccaoptestyou can get the legendary "Hello World" in your console:> [wuzk@localhost wuzk]$ ccaoptest > > Hello World!The code above is a simple c++ code, with a class Foo, and it's member function showMessage.and now
